## 3D Game Engine Project
A personal game development tool for my own edification. I started working on this in March of 2016. Currently working towards completing a small FPS/platforming game. You can find a demo for it here. I am recording a video once or twice a week bundled with the source code and a Windows build. These videos are recaps of my progress and me explaining how I approached interesting technical hurdles.

Current features include:

* Tabbed editor with a scene editor, game view, scene graph, profiler, and more.
* Mesh collision detection, raycasting, and rigidbody simulation
- Custom level and model serialization
- Basic asset pipeline
- Basic "mega-shader" system

Please go to the [Project homepage](https://yamgine.handmade.network/) to see the development log!
